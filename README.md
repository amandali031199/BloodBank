# BloodBank
BloodBank is a database system website to be used internally by a hypothetical company's (Vampire PVT LTD) employees to track inflow and outflow of blood. This website was created using python, flask, html and css. The main purpose of this course project was to learn how to verify functions through mathematical reasoning and proof using Dafny. For this project, I was in charge of backend handling of the warning system (notifies employees when blood supply for a certain type is running low), and adding tested/non-tested blood to the database.
